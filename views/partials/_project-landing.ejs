    <div class="project-overview-body">It was an honor to be able to influence a sport I love so much through my art and design. Coming from a strong racing heritage and successful racing career it seemed to be a perfect fit for me to help with the start of the new Pro American Motorcycle Championship. I was given a lot of freedom in this project creatively and had the opportunity to really push my capabilities as a designer. This project was completed over the course of nearly a year and involved everything from logo development, brand identity, sales & media decks, at track collateral, business collateral, print advertising, web advertising, websites, and supporting logos.</div>
