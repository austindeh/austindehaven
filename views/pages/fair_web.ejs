      <p class="observable body spacing-small">Our old website was large with a lot of unused code and content. So the first objective was doing a large audit to see what could be deprecated and what could be enhanced. Since our codebase had no gaurdrails and was touched by so many people it turned into ever-tangled code spaghetti. We decided our best course of action was to tear the whole thing down and rebuild it from the ground up in doing this we would redesign our homepage as well as add a marketplace.
